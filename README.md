### User Stories Completed

* As a user I should be able to access the BookSmart home page so I can search for authors by name and/or books by title.

* As a user I should be able to sign in and out of a secure account so that I can keep my stored information private.

* As a user I should be able to view a page containing information about any book that I search for (provided the book exists), and add that particular book to my bookshelf so that I can keep track of books that I want to read.

* As a user I should be able to update books on my bookshelf from "unread" to "read" so I can keep track of all of the books I have read.

* As a user I should be able to view a page containing information about any author that I search for (provided the author is a real person), and add that particular author to my "Authors to Read" list so that I can keep track of authors whose books I may want to read in the future.

* As a user I should be able to access a list of a particular author's books from that author's information page so that I can peruse books of that author's that I may want to read.
